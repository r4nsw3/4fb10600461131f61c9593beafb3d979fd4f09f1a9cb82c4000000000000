  |   Last released in 2008, The Last Remnant captured the hearts and       |
  |   minds of gamers with its enthralling story, countless characters      |
  |   and intricate battle system. Now this cult classic RPG is back with   |
  |   a Remastered version and is coming to Nintendo Switch with even       |
  |   more beautiful graphics, enhanced via an updated game engine.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There exists a world woven together by four races: Mitra, Yama,       |
  |   Qsiti, and Sovani.                                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In this world, mysterious objects called "Remnants" have existed      |
  |   since ancient times. Who created these objects? When? And for what    |
  |   reason? No one knew nor had the means to know, but continued to       |
  |   extract and use their colossal power.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   However, the Remnants' immense power gradually caused the world to    |
  |   fall out of balance. As further separation tore apart those who       |
  |   rule and those who follow, a war broke out - the beginning of a       |
  |   long and endless strife.                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A thousand years later, this story begins.                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |   A command-style battle with ever-changing scenarios.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Coming in contact with enemies on the field will trigger battles.     |
  |   Strategize and make full use of the commands that change constantly   |
  |   depending on the positions and state of friendly and enemy forces.    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Morale of friendly forces greatly affects the outcome of battle.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In battle, morale expresses the spirit of individuals and groups of   |
  |   both friendly and enemy forces. Higher morale has advantageous        |
  |   effects such as increasing the attack stat to deal more damage, or    |
  |   decreasing damage dealt by the enemy.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
